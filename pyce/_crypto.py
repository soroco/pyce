This file implements convergent encryption logic for use in a deduplicating
storage system.  It is designed to be used in tandem with an import loader in
Python that can load encrypted files.

Example use:

>>> from pyce.crypto import encrypt_path, decryptf
>>> hash, key = encrypt_path('pyce/hello.pyc')[0]
>>> print(decryptf('pyce/hello.pyce', key))
